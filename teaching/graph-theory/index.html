<p><i><b>Note:</b> This webpage is for the course as lectured in 2013-14, and is now likely out of date. <a href="http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/study/undergrad/current_units/unit/?id=837">The page on the department website</a> is more likely to be accurate.</i></p>

<p><strong>Introduction to Graph Theory</strong> is the second part of <strong>Topics in Discrete Mathematics</strong> (MATH30002 and MATHM0009).</p>

<p>My name is <a href="../">Matthew Aldridge</a>. My email address is <a href="mailto:m.aldridge@bristol.ac.uk">m.aldridge@bristol.ac.uk</a>.</p>

Each topic will last about one lecture. The sixth lecture (Thursday 20 February) will be a problems class.</p>

<p>Printed lecture notes for lecture <i>n</i> should be available here a few days after lecture <i>n</i>, or
in hardcopy at lecture <i>n</i>+2ish.</p>



<h3>Problem sheet</h3>

<p>This part of the course has <a href="gt-problems.pdf"><strong>problem sheet</strong></a>. The sheet notes which questions should be handed in
to the box in the foyer of the school of mathematics by <strong>Thursday 20 February, 1000</strong>,
and will be returned in the problems class that afternoon. You are reminded that the only way
you get feedback on this course is by submitting work and collecting it back once it has been
marked and commented on. The unmarked questions may be completed (or otherwise) at your leisure.</p>

<p>I will make a <a href="exam.pdf"><strong>past exam question</strong></a> available with <a href="exam-sols/">worked answers</a>.</p>



<h3>Admin things</h3>

<p>This section lasts for six lectures from Monday 10 to Thursday 20 February 2014. Lectures are:
  <ul>
    <li> Monday 10 and 17 February, 1500, SM4;
    <li> Wednesday 12 and 19 February. 1100, SM4;
    <li> Thursday 13 and 20 February, 1500, SM2.
  </ul></p>


<p>This  part of the course marks a clean break with the previous part on <a href="http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/~jb12407/discrete-maths-2014/">error-correcting codes</a>.</p>

<p>The final part of the course (24 Februrary to 6 March) is Graph Colouring, lectured by <a href="http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/people/profile/kj12413">Dr Karen Gunderson</a>. That part of the course will assume knowledge of the material from this part.</p>






<h3>Books</h3>

<p>It should be possible to learn the material in this part of the course without using a textbook, but you
may find them useful.</p>

<p>The main resources I used in writing lecture notes were:
  <ul>
    <li> B Bollobas. <i>Modern Graph Theory</i>. Graduate Texts in Mathematics, Springer, 1998.
      (Mostly Chapter I, but also parts of III, IV and VIII.) <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SbZKSZ-1qrwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false">[Google books]</a>
    <li> <a href="http://maths.straylight.co.uk/tdm">Dr Graeme Taylor's notes from last year's version of this course</a>. (But note that the content of the course has changed a little.)
    <li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Graph_theory">Wikipedia</a>.
  </ul>
Bollobas is impressively comprehensive - it covers this part of the course, the Graph Colouring part of the course, and a great deal more besides. However, it moves through the basic material extremely quickly, and the exercises vary from the pretty difficult to the almost impossible.</p>

<p>Any introductory book on graph theory is likely to cover the material in this part of the course. Some examples I hear good things about are:
  <ul>
    <li> JA Bondy and USR Murty. <i>Graph Theory</i>. Graduate Texts in Mathematics, Springer, 2008.
    <li> JA Bondy and USR Murty. <i>Graph Theory and Applications</i>. North-Holland, 1976. <a href="http://book.huihoo.com/pdf/graph-theory-With-applications/">Available for free online</a>
    <li> R Diestel. <i>Graph Theory</i>. Graduate Texts in Mathematics, Springer, 1997. <a href="http://diestel-graph-theory.com/basic.html">Available for free online</a>
    <li> R Grimaldi.<i>Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics: An applied introduction</i>, fifth edition.
      Pearson, 2014.
    <li> RJ Wilson. <i>Introduction to Graph Theory</i>, fifth edition. Prentice Hall, 2010. <a href="https://archive.org/details/IntroductionToGraphTheory">Earlier edition available for free online</a>
  </ul>
  




<h3>Office hours</h3>

<p>Office hours are Thursday 13, 20, and 27 February, 1330--1430 in the Heilbronn Institute
area on the second floor of <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/maps/google/?latlng=51.457904,-2.607358999999974&t=0&h=1">Howard House</a>. Alternatively, <a href="mailto:m.aldridge@bristol.ac.uk">email</a> to
try and arrange a different time.</p>



<h3>Projects</h3>

<p>Fourth-year students also must complete a project on some part of the course, for 20% of their mark.</p>

<p>The written project should demonstrate your independent study, an awareness of a broader literature and a critical evaluation of how the basic ideas may be further developed. The project should be neatly typeset (such as in LaTeX), be between 5–10 pages in length, and will be marked on the 0–100 scale for accuracy, clarity, and depth.</p>

<p>At most one student will be allowed to claim a particular topic and topics will be assigned on a first-come first-served basis. If you would like to work on a topic not listed, you are invited to discuss the matter with the appropriate lecturer. To claim a topic, set up a meeting with the relevant lecturer.</p>

<p>Suggested topics on basic graph theory are:
  <ul>
    <li> <b>The graph isomorphism problem:</b> It can be difficult to tell if two graphs are isomorphic or not. No polynomial algorithm is known for this - although it's not so hard as to be NP-complete either. A project could discuss the computational complexity of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism_problem">graph isomorphism problem</a>, and investigate particular families of graphs, such as trees and planar graphs, where it is easier to solve.
    <li> <b>The Hamiltonian cycle problem:</b> While deciding if a graph has an Eulerian trail or circuit is very easy, deciding if it it has a Hamiltonian cycle (or path) is very hard - it's NP-complete. A project could discuss the computational complexity of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path_problem">Hamiltonian cycle problem</a>, and investigate some algorithms used to detect Hamiltonian paths and cycles. Alternatively, a project could investigate sufficient (but not necessary) conditions for Hamiltonian cycles to exist in graphs and directed graphs, generalizing Dirac's theorem. <b><i>Taken</i></b>
    <li> <b>Algorithms for embedding planar graphs:</b> A project could investigate algorithms for producing an embedding of a planar graph. This project could contain a significant computational aspect. <b><i>Taken</i></b>
    <li> <b>Crossing numbers:</b> Some nonplanar graphs are "almost planar", in that they can be drawn with very few edge crossings. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_number_(graph_theory)"><i>crossing number</i></a> of a graph is the minimum number of edge  crossings required to embed a given graph in the plane. A project could investigate some bounds on the crossing number, perhaps concentrating on 'Turan's brick factory problem' on the crossing number of the complete bipartite graph. <b><i>Taken</i></b>
    <li> <b>Further spectral graph theory:</b> In lectures we saw a few properties of the spectrum of the adjacency matrix. A project could prove further properties of the spectrum, including results relating the spectrum to the chromatic number of the graph. A project could also investigate other matrices, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix">Laplacian</a>, that can be associated with a graph. <b><i>Taken</i></b>
    <li> <b>Stable matching:</b> We've seen that a matching in a graph ensures each girl and boy can get married to a member of the opposite sex whom they like. More likely, each girl has an order of preference on the boys she knows, and each boy has an order of preference on the girls he knows. A matching where no pair of couples would wish to each get divorced and swap partners is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem"><i>stable matching</i></a>. A project could investigate the existence of stable matchings in bipartite graphs, algorithms for finding them, and analysing when the matching is optimal for one of the genders. <b><i>Taken</i></b>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Deadlines for projects:
  <ul>
    <li> Have a project topic approved by 10 March.
    <li> Meet with the lecturer to review progress by 21 March.
    <li> Hand in project by <b>4 April</b>.
  </ul>
