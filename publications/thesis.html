<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>A central problem in the operation of large wireless networks is 
how to deal with interference - the unwanted signals being sent
by transmitters that a receiver is not interested in.  This thesis
looks at ways of combating such interference.</p>

<p>In Chapters 1 and 2, we outline the necessary information and
communication theory background.  We define the concept of capacity -
the highest rate at which information can be sent through a network
with arbitrarily low probability of error.  We also include an overview
of a new set of schemes for dealing with interference known as
interference alignment, paying special attention to a channel-state-based
strategy called ergodic interference alignment.</p>

<p>In Chapter 3, we consider the operation of large regular and random networks
by treating interference as background noise.  We consider the local
performance of a single node, and the global performance of a very
large network.
<em>This chapter is joint work with Oliver Johnson and Robert Piechocki.</em>
</p>

<p>In Chapter 4, we use ergodic interference alignment to derive the
asymptotic sum-capacity of large random dense networks.  These
networks are derived from a physical model of node placement where
signal strength decays over the distance between transmitters and receivers.
<em>This chapter is joint work with Oliver Johnson and Robert Piechocki.  This
research has been <a href="interference-alignment-based.html">published in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</a>,
and <a href="asymptotic-sum-capacity.html">in the Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</a>.</em>
</p>

<p>In Chapter 5, we look at methods of reducing the long
time delays incurred by ergodic interference alignment.  We decrease
the delay for full performance of the scheme, and analyse
the tradeoff between reducing delay and lowering the communication rate.
<em>This chapter is joint work with Oliver Johnson and Robert Piechocki. This
research has been submiited to IEEE Transactions on Communication Theory -
<a href="delay-rate.html">a preprint is available on the arXiv</a>.</em>
</p>

<p>In Chapter 6, we outline a problem of discovering which users interfere with which;
a situation that is equivalent to the problem of pooled group testing for defective items.
We then present some new work that uses information
theoretic techniques to attack group testing.
We introduce for the first time the concept of the group testing
channel, which allows for modelling of a wide range of statistical
error models for testing. We derive new results on the number
of tests required to accurately detect defective items, including
when using sequential `adaptive' tests.</p>

<p>Chapter 7 concludes and gives pointers for further work.</p>
