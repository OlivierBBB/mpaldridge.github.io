 Me: Matthew Aldridge Coauthors: Oliver Johnson | Jonathan Scarlett | Leonardo Baldassini | Robert Piechocki | Karen Gunderson Coauthors of coauthors include: Jennifer Chakravarty | Fraser Daly | Thomas Kealy | Dino Sejdinovic | Jason Semeraro Coauthors of coauthors of coauthors include: Paul Erd≈ës  My academic ancestry goes me &amp;mdash; Oliver Johnson &amp;mdash; Yuri Suhov &amp;mdash; Yakov Sinai &amp;mdash; Andrey Kolmogorov &amp;mdash; Nikolai Luzin &amp;mdash; Dmitri Egorov &amp;mdash; Nikolai Bugaev, who apparently had three supervisors, so it gets kind of complicated, but you can probably get to whomever you want from there.</description>

 In person: My office is PRD 9.320 in the Physics Research Deck. Here&amp;rsquo;s a map of where the building is. The usual route to the Physics Research deck is from the 8th floor of EC Stoner at staircase 4. Once up to the Maths area on the 9th floor, my office is back on yourself, towards the Observatory.
